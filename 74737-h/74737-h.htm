<h2 class="nobreak">THE ROCKING-HORSE PONY
WHO WANTED BLUE EYES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright cold March morning and
round the four corners of Santa Claus’s
Snow Palace on the very tip-top of the
North Pole the wind swept blustering
and shouting on his way.</p>

<p>It was so early in the morning that
some of Santa Claus’s Brownies had not
yet finished their household tasks.</p>

<p>Little Crusty, oldest of the Brownies,
who was in charge of the reindeer and
who, in spite of a snarled-up face, had a
very tender heart, was still busy in the
stable, brushing the brown coats of the
eight tiny reindeer and making them
glossy and neat for the day.</p>

<p>Down in the kitchen Sweet-Tooth,
chief of the candy cooks, was showing
his tidy little band of helpers, each in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
white apron and cap, how to make very-black
licorice drops.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="Sweet-Tooth in the kitchen"></div>

<p>‘Now that March is here some Brownie
is sure to catch a Spring cold,’ said Sweet-Tooth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> 
measuring and mixing with all his
might, ‘and there is nothing better than
licorice drops for a cold in the Spring.’</p>

<p>Out in front of the Palace stood Nimbletoes,
sweeping off the steps with great
strokes of his broom. Nimbletoes, who
could run as fast and jump as high as any
Brownie who ever lived, was late with his
work this morning because he had been
running and playing in the wind.</p>

<p>‘I could run for miles and miles this
morning,’ said Nimbletoes with a last
little jump, ‘but I suppose I must finish
my work. Here goes!’</p>

<p>And Nimbletoes made his arms fly
round like the sails of a windmill as he
swept the steps with great wide flourishes
of his broom.</p>

<p>All the other Brownies were hard at
work in Santa Claus’s work-room, making
Christmas toys. Although December
and Christmas seemed far away, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
you stop to think how many toys Santa
Claus must have ready on Christmas Eve,
you will see why the Brownies were kept
busy the whole year long.</p>

<p>Kindheart was fitting a blue flannel
jacket on a tiny baby doll. Silvertongue
was finishing off a great white furry rabbit,
with gleaming ruby-red eyes and the
cunningest little bob-tail in the world.
Mischief was painting a gay yellow sled.
Fleetfoot was whittling the sticks of a
drum. Santa Claus was fitting out a little
boy’s tool box, and very great pains he
took with it, too.</p>

<p>Over in a corner sat Merrythought, the
very best toy-maker of them all, and beside
him stood Sharpeyes, the little errand
boy, who picked up pins and threaded
needles and found lost scissors for all the
other Brownies. But for the past week,
as a special treat, Sharpeyes had been
working upon a toy, too. Merrythought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
had showed him how to make a Rocking-Horse,
and now the gay little prancing
steed stood before them finished, except
for a leather bridle that Sharpeyes was
trying to fit into the Pony’s mouth.</p>

<p>He was a little brown Pony with a long
brown tail and a wavy brown mane. His
mouth was a bright, bright red. He wore
a yellow saddle fastened by neat little
straps. And in his head there sparkled
two dark brown eyes, quite the prettiest
brown eyes, Sharpeyes thought, that a
little Pony had ever worn.</p>

<p>But, in spite of this, there was something
about those pretty brown eyes that
did not please the Rocking-Horse Pony.
And this is the way he showed his feeling
about it.</p>

<p>The first thing that morning, when
Merrythought and Sharpeyes went to
work on the Rocking-Horse Pony,
Sharpeyes said, ‘I think I will give my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Pony brown eyes, Merrythought, because
they will match his brown coat so
well.’</p>

<p>So into the little Pony’s head went the
dark brown eyes.</p>

<p>This was the first time the Pony had
been able to see, you know, and Sharpeyes
and Merrythought both laughed to
watch him stare in pleasure and astonishment
round the work-room, already fairly
well filled with toys.</p>

<p>The little Rocking-Horse Pony looked
at Santa Claus, he looked at the Brownies,
he looked at the toys. Then slowly
and taking plenty of time the Rocking-Horse
Pony began to rock himself all
around the room.</p>

<p>He stopped before the woolly lambs
and stared earnestly into their mild brown
eyes. He rocked round to the furry rabbits
and gazed at their eyes of ruby-red.
He studied the pussy-cats and the toy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
dogs, the tigers and the elephants, the
Teddy bears with their eyes of yellow and
brown and black. But when he reached
the corner where Kindheart was at work
upon his baby dolls, each one with eyes
of beautiful bright blue, then the Rocking-Horse
Pony stood still before them
and quite refused to move.</p>

<p>He shook himself impatiently when
Sharpeyes called him to come. He did
not turn his head when Merrythought
snapped his fingers and said, ‘Here,
Pony! Here, sir, come!’</p>

<p>He not only stood still before the dolls,
but he looked and he looked at their lovely
blue eyes. And the next moment, with a
wink and a blink, the Pony’s own brown
eyes flew out of his head and landed upon
the floor!</p>

<p>‘Good gracious!’ exclaimed Merrythought.
‘Put them in again, Sharpeyes,
as fast as you can.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Into the little Pony’s head went the
dark brown eyes again. But—would
you believe it?—in less than no time the
brown eyes lay upon the floor once more,
and the pony’s red mouth wore a satisfied
smile that seemed to say, ‘Now see!
I’ve done it again.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t like this,’ said Merrythought,
shaking his head. ‘I never knew eyes to
fall out of a Pony’s head before.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I don’t put them in the right
way,’ answered Sharpeyes, looking troubled.
‘This is the first toy I have ever
made. Watch me, Merrythought, and
see that I do it well.’</p>

<p>Merrythought and Sharpeyes both
worked away until it seemed as if the
brown eyes would never come out again.</p>

<p>But in less than ten minutes not only
were the eyes out of the Pony’s head,
but they were lost as well. Sharpeyes
searched for almost half an hour before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
he found them. And where do you think
they were? You would never, never
guess. One of them was tucked in the
corner of a doll carriage under a pink-and-white
wool cover. That was strange
enough. But the other eye was stuffed
into the wide-open red mouth of a poor
little trumpeting elephant, who was so
surprised that his thin gray tail stood
straight out with excitement and fright.
This was stranger and stranger still. It
almost seemed as if the Pony had hidden
them on purpose himself, though no one
could imagine how he had done such a
thing. A lively little toy monkey, who
had been watching the Pony, might have
told something about it, if he had wished.
But he didn’t speak a word.</p>

<p>‘What ails my Pony, Merrythought?’
asked Sharpeyes. ‘I never knew toys
acted in this way. Do you think perhaps
he doesn’t like his brown eyes?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>‘Why wouldn’t he like his brown
eyes?’ replied Merrythought. ‘He is
simply full of fun and likes a joke. But
we must put those eyes in to stay. Let
us go and look for some of Mr. Mendham’s
glue. He may have left a little
when he was here a year or so ago.
There is no glue in the world like Mr.
Mendham’s.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Mendham is a very fine Toy
Tinker, isn’t he?’ asked Sharpeyes. ‘I
believe he could mend any broken toy.
Do you remember the Christmas time
he and Mrs. Mendham came here to help
Santa Claus make the toys?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I do,’ answered Merrythought,
smiling at the question. ‘He
came to help because we Brownies were
all ill in bed from eating too many of
Sweet-Tooth’s rich caramel creams.’</p>

<p>‘Does he live far from here?’ asked
Sharpeyes. ‘I have never seen his house.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>‘Not so far,’ was Merrythought’s reply.
‘Straight down past the Eskimo village
and then on to a little wood of evergreen
trees. His house stands there with a sign
over the door. Now let us try to find a
bit of Mr. Mendham’s glue.’</p>

<p>Neither Sharpeyes nor Merrythought
glanced at the Pony. If they had they
would have seen in a moment that he had
listened to every word they said.</p>

<p>At the words ‘Toy Tinker’ the Pony’s
tail had begun to swish. When Merrythought
had told where Mr. Mendham
lived, the Pony’s ears had twitched to
and fro. And no sooner did the Pony
have a moment to himself than over to
the window he rocked and tried to push
it open with his little red nose. How he
knew his way about without any eyes I
don’t know. And once he had opened the
window, did he mean to jump out?</p>

<p>Nobody can tell. For Brownie Kindheart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
felt the cold air on his doll babies
and closed the window. And just then
back came Merrythought and Sharpeyes
with a pot of Mr. Mendham’s glue.
Neatly and firmly the brown eyes were
glued in, this time to stay, though the
naughty little Pony rocked and pranced
to show that he did not like it at all.</p>

<p>But Sharpeyes was pleased.</p>

<p>‘He is a beautiful Pony,’ said Sharpeyes
with pride. ‘I will put on his bridle
now and then he will be finished.’</p>

<p>But the Rocking-Horse Pony did not
want to wear his bridle. He shut his
mouth tight and tossed his head. He
rocked himself to and fro with a thump
and a bump. It was plain to be seen that
the Rocking-Horse Pony did not wish to
wear a bridle. And with a sudden toss
and jerk of his head he managed to break
the bridle quite in two.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ exclaimed Sharpeyes, unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
tumbling backward and sitting down
hard upon the floor. ‘Oh! What shall we
do?’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="Rocking-Horse Pony"></div>

<p>‘Fetch a new bridle out of the store-room,’
answered Merrythought, helping
his friend to his feet. ‘Come along and I
will show you where they are.’</p>

<p>Now every one in the work-room was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
as busy as could be. No one saw that
Sharpeyes and Merrythought had left
the room. Much less did they notice the
Rocking-Horse Pony, who now rocked
quietly over to the door, moved out into
the hall, and started down the stairs with
a thump! thump! thump! Just as softly as
he could manage, you may be sure.</p>

<p>The first one to spy the Rocking-Horse
Pony was Nimbletoes, still busy
at sweeping the Palace front steps.</p>

<p>Down the steps behind Nimbletoes’
back bumped the Pony, and then off he
started over the snow at a rocking, galloping
canter that surprised even himself, it
carried him over the ground at such a
pace.</p>

<p>In the mean time Nimbletoes stood
staring. He couldn’t believe his eyes.
For a whole half-minute he stood there,
leaning on his broom, his eyes and his
mouth open wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Then Nimbletoes gave a great leap into
the air.</p>

<p>‘Hi, there!’ he shouted up at the work-room
windows. ‘Hi, there! Sharpeyes!
Merrythought! Your Pony has run away!
Brownies! Brownies! Come! Come!’</p>

<p>At this loud shouting all the Brownies,
and Santa Claus, too, rushed to the work-room
windows and looked out. Up from
the kitchen scampered Sweet-Tooth,
leaving the very-black licorice drops to
his band of little cooks. Out of the stable
hurried little Crusty, his scarlet cap tipped
over one ear and the reindeer’s hair-brush
clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>They all saw a strange sight—the
Rocking-Horse Pony rocking swiftly
away over the snow and after him
Brownie Nimbletoes, using his broom
as a staff, taking great flying leaps and
bounds, the wind lifting him off his feet
time and time again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>‘My Pony! My Pony!’ called Sharpeyes,
running toward the door. ‘Oh,
Merrythought! Oh, Brownies! Help me,
do!’</p>

<p>At this, all the Brownies trooped after
him, down the stairs, out the front door,
and over the snow, while Santa Claus
stood on the steps, laughing and waving
them on.</p>

<p>‘Catch him, Brownies! Catch him!’
called Santa Claus. ‘Oh, what a race!’</p>

<p>A race it was! For the Rocking-Horse
Pony seemed fairly to skim over the
ground, and behind him, blown by the
wind and carried by their own swift little
feet, came the Brownies, every one, for
Sweet-Tooth and Crusty had joined them
and were running quite as fast as any one
else.</p>

<p>The Rocking-Horse Pony seemed to
know where he wanted to go. On and on
he rocked over the ice and snow. Now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
came to a group of low round huts made
of snow, where the Eskimos lived, fathers
and mothers and little boy and girl Eskimos,
too. Smoke was pouring from the
hole in the top of each hut, and this smoke
the wind caught and gayly blew hither
and yon. The little Eskimo boys and
girls, bundled in fur, ran out of the huts,
their long-haired dogs barking at their
heels, and they all, children and dogs,
stared in amazement at the galloping
Rocking-Horse Pony who was followed
so closely by the gay band of Brownies,
laughing and shouting and waving their
arms as they sped by.</p>

<p>Now came the evergreen trees, tall and
thick and green, and the Rocking-Horse
Pony and the Brownies found themselves
racing through a dense little wood.</p>

<p>‘I know where he is going!’ shouted
Nimbletoes, who, with Brownie Fleetfoot,
was running well in the lead. ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
believe he is going to Mr. Mendham’s
house!’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="Rocking-Horse Pony and the Brownies racing through a dense little wood"></div>

<p>The news was passed down the line
until the last one in the procession, little
old Crusty, heard the tidings.</p>

<p>‘He is going to Mr. Mendham’s, we
all believe!’</p>

<p>Soon the Brownies set up another
shout.</p>

<p>‘There is Mr. Mendham’s house! We
are right! Sharpeyes’ Pony is going to
Mr. Mendham’s house.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="Mr. Mendham’s house"></div>

<p>Between two tall trees before them
there stood a little house, a little white
house with a bright red chimney, green
window-boxes, and a green front door.
Over the door hung a sign—</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="large">MR. MENDHAM</span><br>
TOY TINKER</p>

<p>The Brownies saw the Rocking-Horse
Pony take the knocker on the green front
door in his mouth and rap smartly—Rap-a-tap-tap!
There was no answer,
so the Rocking-Horse Pony gently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
pushed the door open and rocked inside.
The door shut behind him with a thump.</p>

<p>Now out behind the house, busily
hanging up a basketful of clothes, were
Mr. and Mrs. Mendham. They spied the
Brownies, they came running forward,
and when they heard about the Rocking-Horse
Pony they crept into the house on
tiptoe, followed by the Brownies, to see
what the Pony was doing now.</p>

<p>There he was in Mr. Mendham’s
work-room, rocking round and round,
looking for something with all his might
and main. He looked high, he looked low,
he even looked in the corners and on the
floor. But at last he gave up the search
and stood still in the middle of the room,
and the Brownies and Mr. and Mrs.
Mendham saw that the tears were rolling
down his little brown face. He looked as
if his heart was broken. What was the
matter with the Rocking-Horse Pony?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>The mended toys in the work-room
were trying to help the little brown
Pony.</p>

<p>‘I know Mr. Mendham keeps his eyes
in that basket over there,’ said a black-and-white
dog with a bright red tongue,
‘but, as you can see, he hasn’t a blue eye
left, not one.’</p>

<p>‘He put his last blue eyes in my head,’
said a big white furry kitten, who had a
golden bell tied about his neck. ‘For my
part I don’t like blue eyes. I prefer green.
They shine so well in the dark. If Mr.
Mendham will give me green eyes, you
may have my blue.’</p>

<p>At this kind offer all the toys began to
call out, ‘Mr. Mendham! Mr. Mendham!’</p>

<p>So Mr. Mendham and the Brownies
trooped into the room.</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you tell me you wanted
blue eyes?’ asked Sharpeyes as he wiped
the tears from his little Pony’s face. ‘Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
course you shall have them if Mr. Mendham
is willing to make the change.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, certainly,’ agreed Mr.
Mendham, who was a kind-hearted man.
‘Green eyes always look well in a cat,
and there is no reason why this Pony
shouldn’t have blue eyes, though I will
say I never gave them to a Rocking-Horse
before.’</p>

<p>‘Blue eyes are so beautiful,’ murmured
the Rocking-Horse Pony. ‘I couldn’t
bear to think of starting out next Christmas
Eve with brown eyes in my head.’</p>

<p>So Mr. Mendham made the change in
a twinkling.</p>

<p>The white cat was more than satisfied
with his new green eyes.</p>

<p>‘They have a fine sparkle and gleam,’
he purred, with a proud wave of his tail.
‘Blue eyes are too girlish for me.’</p>

<p>And the Rocking-Horse Pony was
happier than words can tell. He smiled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
he rocked, he bumped about in a very
ecstasy of joy. When the time came, he
rocked home, with Sharpeyes on his back,
in a very whirl of pleasure.</p>

<p>‘Blue eyes! Blue eyes!’ he sang to
himself as he bumped over the snow.</p>

<p>When Sharpeyes showed the Pony to
Santa Claus and told him what had happened,
Santa Claus laughed and rubbed
the Rocking-Horse Pony upon his soft
brown nose.</p>

<p>‘I know a little boy who likes blue
eyes the very best of all,’ said Santa
Claus, ‘and you shall go to live with him
next Christmas, if you wish.’</p>

<p>When he heard this, the Rocking-Horse
Pony was so happy he thought
his heart would burst with joy.</p>

<p>So if, next Christmas, you meet a little
boy who has a Rocking-Horse Pony
with bright blue eyes, you may know
that the Pony was made by Brownie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Sharpeyes and that he came down on
Christmas Eve in Santa Claus’s sleigh
straight from the Snow Palace on the
very tip-top of the North Pole.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GAY LITTLE TOWN
OF BO-PEEP</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> stood on the front steps of
his Snow Palace at the very tip-top of
the North Pole.</p>

<p>Softly, very softly, the great door behind
him swung open and out rushed the
Brownies, pulling on their scarlet caps,
fastening their mittens, and laughing and
shouting and calling as they came.</p>

<p>‘Santa Claus! Santa Claus!’ shouted
the Brownies. ‘Here we come, Santa
Claus! Here we all come!’</p>

<p>‘What does this mean?’ asked Santa
Claus in surprise, his eyes twinkling with
fun. ‘Why aren’t you hard at work upstairs,
making toys? Come, come, now!’</p>

<p>And Santa Claus laughed in spite of
himself to see his Brownies turning somersaults
in the soft snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>‘Oh, Santa Claus, we want a holiday!’
shouted the Brownies. ‘We don’t feel like
working at all. We want a holiday, Santa
Claus. Do say that we may.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, indeed,’ nodded Santa Claus,
laughing again to see his Brownies’ antics
in the snow. ‘You will work all the
better for a little fun. Be off, every
one.’</p>

<p>So off they went, three by three, each
little group of Brownies with a plan of its
own.</p>

<p>Sharpeyes, the little errand boy, Merrythought,
the very best toy-maker of them
all, and little Crusty, who was in charge
of the reindeer, ran off to call on a nearby
family of seals.</p>

<p>Mischief, Nimbletoes, and Fleetfoot
scampered down to a great smooth
stretch of snow back of the stable where
the eight tiny reindeer lived.</p>

<p>‘We want to run races, Santa Claus,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
called they, ‘more than anything else in
the world.’</p>

<p>Kindheart, Silvertongue, and Sweet-Tooth,
chief of the candy cooks, stood
for a moment wondering just where they
would go.</p>

<p>‘We mean to take a long walk,’ said
Silvertongue to Santa Claus, who stood
by their side. ‘Tell us where to go, Santa
Claus, for we don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever been to the Town of
Bo-Peep?’ asked Santa Claus. ‘I would
go there, if I were you. It used to be a
gay, merry little Town, but you will find
it very different now. Stay as long as you
like. There may be some work for you
to do.’</p>

<p>So the three Brownies set off for the
Town of Bo-Peep.</p>

<p>‘It is too far to walk all the way,’ said
Santa Claus. ‘You had better borrow my
handkerchief for a sail.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>A gentle breeze was blowing, and as
the Brownies held up Santa Claus’s great
white handkerchief, with S.C. embroidered
in the corner, the wind filled the
handkerchief like a sail and took them
steadily along.</p>

<p>It was great fun to skim over the
ground and surprising to see how quickly
they traveled. They soon left the cold
and snow behind. Presently the grass
grew green and the sun shone warm and
the three little Brownies put down the
great handkerchief and tripped merrily
along the road hand in hand.</p>

<p>‘I smell the sea,’ said Sweet-Tooth,
who, being a cook, had a very sharp
nose.</p>

<p>On they ran, and at a turn in the road
they came upon the sea, wide and blue
and sparkling under a summer sky. Far
out in the water stood a Lighthouse. Below
the road stretched the beach, a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
curve of firm, white sand, and back of the
beach lay the little Town of Bo-Peep.</p>

<p>It was a pretty little Town with red
roofs and chimney pots, and each little
house had its own gay little garden
plot.</p>

<p>But the Town was quiet, no one walked
about the streets. And though the tide
was low and the cool wet sand lay bare,
not a single child was playing on the
beach.</p>

<p>‘They have all gone away,’ said Kindheart.
‘The Town seems empty to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they have gone on a picnic,’
suggested Silvertongue, ‘or for a sail
across the bay.’</p>

<p>But Sweet-Tooth shook his head.</p>

<p>‘The mothers are at home,’ said he.
‘I can see the smoke rising from the
chimneys and I think I can smell baking
bread.’</p>

<p>‘Let us go down into the town,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Kindheart, ‘and look about. Santa Claus
said there might be work to do.’</p>

<p>Down in the town the three little
Brownies walked quietly along, past the
neat houses, past the gay flower-beds,
until they came to a little shop, and here
the Brownies stood stock still on the
sandy road.</p>

<p>It was a Candy Shop. At least a big
sign over the door said so. But the
blinds were pulled down and the door
was shut tight and there was a card in
the window that read</p>

<p class="center">NO CANDY SOLD HERE</p>

<p>The Brownies looked at one another.
Sweet-Tooth’s face wore a horrified look.
He couldn’t speak. He managed to peep
under the window-shade, but all the window
held was a dismal row of empty
glass candy jars.</p>

<p>‘It must be there are no children in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the Town,’ said Silvertongue in a low
voice.</p>

<p>And Kindheart and Sweet-Tooth could
only nod their heads in reply.</p>

<p>A few steps beyond the Candy Shop
they came upon another little store.
‘TOY SHOP’ was painted on the window.
But here too the blinds were down
and the door locked fast and thick dust
covered the doorstep and the window-ledge.
Kindheart stood on tiptoe and
read a card tacked on the door.</p>

<p class="center">NO TOYS SOLD HERE</p>

<p>‘What can be the matter?’ whispered
the Brownies. ‘Who ever heard before
of a Town where no children lived?’</p>

<p>Down on the beach crept the Brownies
and here strange signs were sprinkled
as thick as blackberries wherever they
might look.</p>

<p class="center">NO PADDLING ON THIS BEACH</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>said a bright blue sign stuck in the sand
here and there.</p>

<p>The Brownies read this aloud and tears
came into gentle Kindheart’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘I never saw a better beach for paddling,’
said he, wiping away his tears
with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>‘Listen to this!’ cried Silvertongue,
standing before a scarlet sign that was
repeated all along the shore.</p>

<p class="center">NO SAND BUILDING ALLOWED</p>

<p>read the scarlet sign in great black letters
that all could see.</p>

<p>‘What about this?’ called Sweet-Tooth,
capering before a green sign over
which he had just stubbed his toe.</p>

<p class="center">NO DIGGING ON THIS BEACH</p>

<p>‘That is what the sign says. But I can’t
believe it. I am going straight through
this Town until I see what they have
done with the children here.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The Brownies did not have far to go
to find the children. A stone’s throw
from the beach stood the school-house,
a dingy red brick building with a tall iron
fence all roundabout.</p>

<p>Under the fence squeezed the Brownies.
They wanted to read a great golden
sign over the school-house door.</p>

<p class="center">THIS SCHOOL OPEN FROM<br>
NINE UNTIL SIX O’CLOCK</p>

<p>Sweet-Tooth read the sign aloud and
would have tumbled to the ground in
his surprise if Silvertongue and Kindheart
had not caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>‘That means all day!’ gasped Sweet-Tooth.
‘They have to go to school all
day!’</p>

<p>Through the school-house window
they could see the heads of the children,
little brown and yellow and black heads,
both curly and straight. Indeed one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
little red head lay on the window-sill, fast
asleep.</p>

<p>‘Tired out, and no wonder,’ murmured
Silvertongue, which was a very harsh
speech for him.</p>

<p>Out of the window floated the voices
of the children droning sleepily over and
over again—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Two times one are two,</div>
<div class="verse">Two times two are four,</div>
<div class="verse">Two times three are six.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Brownies didn’t speak another
word that afternoon. They sat down
round the corner of the school-house
with their backs against the wall and
watched the clock in the church tower
tick the sunny hours away.</p>

<p>At last the clock struck six.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom!</p>

<p>The school-house door opened and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
out trooped the children. As they started
home, the Brownies followed and watched
them as they went.</p>

<p>Some of them peeped in the Toy Shop
window and rattled the latch. Some of
them stood on tiptoe and knocked the
knocker on the Candy Shop door. Some
of them ran away from their big brothers
and sisters and sat on the beach and made
holes in the sand with their fingers and
piled up little heaps. And some of the
children even ran down and put their
toes in the water, they did so want a
little pleasure and fun.</p>

<p>But their big brothers and sisters were
frightened.</p>

<p>‘The King will see you!’ said they.
‘Come home! The King will catch
you!’</p>

<p>So the Children were taken home, and
soon after their supper the candles were
lighted in their bedrooms and the Brownies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
could see the children in their night-gowns
going to bed.</p>

<p>As it grew dusk, the Brownies sat flat
on the lonely beach with no one but the
sandpipers and the seagulls to keep them
company.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Who was the
King? Why were the children treated
so?</p>

<p>The light in the Lighthouse across the
bay blazed out and Kindheart sprang to
his feet.</p>

<p>‘I am going to borrow that little boat,’
said he, pointing to a white boat pulled
up on the beach, ‘and row over to the
Lighthouse. Perhaps some one there can
tell us what it is all about.’</p>

<p>When they reached the Lighthouse two
figures ran down to the shore and helped
them from the boat.</p>

<p>One was that of a little man who
smelled strongly of peppermint candy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>‘He is the Candy Man,’ said Sweet-Tooth
in a flash. And so he proved to be.</p>

<p>The other figure was that of a neat little
lady who held a half-made doll’s dress in
her hand.</p>

<p>‘The Toy Lady,’ said Silvertongue and
Kindheart in a breath. And this was so
too.</p>

<p>The Candy Man and the Toy Lady
both talked at once, they were so excited
at seeing the Brownies and so anxious to
tell their tale.</p>

<p>‘It is the new King’s fault,’ said they,
together. ‘He won’t have a bit of noise.
He doesn’t want the children to romp and
be noisy, and that is why they must go
to school all day and never play on the
beach. That is why he sent us over here
to live. He doesn’t want the children to
eat candy nor to play with toys. All the
King does from morning till night is to
think of different things we mustn’t do and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
then make signs to tell us so. Bo-Peep
Town used to be a gay and merry place
to live in, but now we are miserable, just
miserable. And the children simply long
to have us come back again.’</p>

<p>The Brownies and the Toy Lady and
the Candy Man sat up almost all night
talking things over. Of course matters
couldn’t go on as they were. And once
they had made up their minds what to do,
they fell to work.</p>

<p>For two days and nights they worked
as hard as ever they could. The Candy
Man and Sweet-Tooth made candy, all
kinds. Silvertongue and Kindheart and
the Toy Lady made toys—boats and pails
and shovels and all sorts of sand toys,
fish and stars and patty-pans and cones.</p>

<p>Then early one morning, when it was
darkest, just before dawn, they filled their
little boat with toys and candy and rowed
over to the mainland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The Brownies first helped the Toy
Lady and the Candy Man to open their
little shops and place the toys and candy
inside.</p>

<p>Then Silvertongue and Kindheart and
Sweet-Tooth stole into the Palace and up
to the bedroom where the King and his
little Queen lay sleeping side by side.</p>

<p>They were thoughtful little Brownies,
you must admit. They packed a bag of
clothes for the King and Queen. They
even remembered their golden crowns
and put them in too.</p>

<p>Then they carried the sleeping King
and Queen down to the little boat, rowed
them over to the Lighthouse, and left
them there.</p>

<p>Next morning when the children went
to school there was a new sign on the door.</p>

<p class="center">NO SCHOOL TO-DAY</p>

<p>Some one spied the Toy Shop. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
door was wide open. The window was
filled with brand-new toys, and a fresh
sign was fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p class="center">PENNY TOYS SOLD HERE</p>

<p>At first the children crowded round and
stared. Then they sped to the Candy
Shop. That was wide open, too, every
glass jar filled to the brim with the most
delicious candy ever seen.</p>

<p>‘The sign! The sign!’ shrieked the
children.</p>

<p>There it was, shining and new.</p>

<p class="center">PENNY CANDY SOLD HERE</p>

<p>Down to the beach ran the children,
screaming as they ran. They were so excited
they had forgotten the King.</p>

<p>The beach was covered with glittering
new signs.</p>

<p class="center">PLEASE PADDLE ON THE<br>
BEACH</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>GOOD SAND FOR BUILDING<br>
HERE<br>
<br>
KINDLY DIG ON THIS BEACH</p>

<p>The children scarcely knew what to do
first. Some ran to the Toy Shop, others
to the Candy Man to taste his fine new
wares. How glad they were to see their
old friends, the Toy Lady and the Candy
Man, once more! Some of the children
settled down to dig, some of them fell to
building in the sand, while many of them
pulled off their shoes and stockings and
happily splashed and paddled about in
the cool green waves.</p>

<p>Every one took a holiday, fathers and
mothers too. And that night, when dusk
fell, they were still romping and playing
and enjoying themselves on the beach.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out blazed the light from the
Lighthouse and the figures of the King
and the Queen stood on the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>‘We like it here!’ shouted the King,
making a great deal of noise for such a
quiet man. ‘We mean to stay! It is quiet
here! We never want to live in the Town
again!’</p>

<p>The King and the Queen waved their
hands good-bye. They had reached the
Lighthouse door when the King turned
back.</p>

<p>‘Our crowns!’ he shouted. ‘You may
have them! We don’t want them any
more!’</p>

<p>And he tossed them one by one into
the sea.</p>

<p>When the crowns came floating in on
the beach, the people picked them up
and gave them to the Toy Lady and the
Candy Man.</p>

<p>‘Please be our King and Queen,’ said
they.</p>

<p>But the Toy Lady and the Candy Man
shook their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>‘I would rather sell toys than be a
Queen,’ said the Toy Lady.</p>

<p>‘I would rather make candy than be a
King,’ said the Candy Man.</p>

<p>So, since they had no King nor Queen,
the people locked the front door of the
Palace and threw the key away. The
crowns they fastened over the Toy Shop
and the Candy Shop because they looked
well hanging there.</p>

<p>Bo-Peep Town became overnight what
it had always been before, a gay and lively
and pleasant place in which to live.</p>

<p>And Silvertongue and Kindheart and
Sweet-Tooth went home happy, but not
any more happy than Santa Claus when
he heard what they had done.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the middle of the night. All the
Brownies, and Santa Claus, too, were fast
asleep in their beds in the Snow Palace
at the very tip-top of the North Pole.</p>

<p>It was a cold, frosty night. ‘Whoo-oo-oo!
Whoo-oo-oo!’ sang the West
Wind round the chimneys, in such a
chilly voice, with a tinkle of ice in it, that
the Brownies snuggled down under their
covers and pulled the bed-quilts up about
their ears.</p>

<p>All the Brownies were fast asleep, I
said. But, as the great clock in the hall
downstairs slowly boomed out the hour
of twelve, Brownie Fleetfoot opened his
bright black eyes.</p>

<p>‘Ugh! How cold it is!’ shivered
Brownie Fleetfoot, trying to roll himself
into a ball. ‘It wasn’t so cold when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
went to bed. I wonder what the Moon
is laughing at up there in the sky. He
likes to see me freeze, I guess.’</p>

<p>For a great silver Moon, with a broad
smile on his face, was looking straight in
the window at Fleetfoot, and it did seem
as if he were laughing at some joke of his
own.</p>

<p>‘I will shut my eyes and count ten,’
said Fleetfoot to himself, ‘and then I will
look at the Moon again to see if he is still
laughing at me.’</p>

<p>He shut his black eyes with a snap.
Slowly he counted up to ten. But when
he opened his eyes again he forgot the
Moon entirely.</p>

<p>For beside his bed stood a little figure
dressed in snowy white. He wore a glittering
cap trimmed with a frosty plume,
and over his shoulder, like a soldier’s
musket, he carried a paint-brush, long
and slim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>‘Jack Frost!’ exclaimed Fleetfoot, sitting
up in surprise. ‘Jack Frost! What
are you doing here? No wonder I was
so cold with you standing beside my bed.
That was why the Moon laughed in at
me, I suppose. He saw you all the while.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, he did,’ nodded Jack Frost, unbuttoning
his snowy white coat. ‘How
warm it is in here! He watched me slip
through the crack in the window. It
made him laugh, too, because I have been
tickling you with an icicle trying to wake
you up. Put on your clothes, Fleetfoot,
and come along with me. I have a piece
of work for you to do.’</p>

<p>Jack Frost and Santa Claus and the
Brownies were old, old friends. Jack
Frost was always glad to do Santa Claus
a good turn, such as making Christmas
Day bright and cold, with plenty of snow
and ice for the boys and girls with new
snow-shoes and sleds and skates. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the other hand, as every one knows, all
Brownies, and of course Santa Claus’s
Brownies, too, are never so happy as
when they are being helpful and kind.
These Brownies at the North Pole were
quite used to being called upon, day or
night, to do some kind or thoughtful act.</p>

<p>Fleetfoot was not surprised, therefore,
when he heard that Jack Frost had a
piece of work for him to do. He dressed
in a twinkling. It took him only a moment
to slip into his neat little suit, draw
on his pointed Brownie shoes, and pull
his scarlet Brownie cap well down over
his ears.</p>

<p>‘I am ready,’ he whispered, creeping
over to the door.</p>

<p>But Jack Frost laid a chilly little hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>‘Bring a bell with you,’ murmured
Jack Frost in the Brownie’s ear. ‘You
will need to use a bell to-night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>‘A bell?’ whispered back Fleetfoot.
‘What kind of bell? A dinner bell? A
bicycle bell?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Jack Frost, his finger
on his lips, ‘a cat’s bell. Hush!’</p>

<p>For Brownie Mischief had flung out
his arms and tossed his quilt off on the
floor, and Sharpeyes had turned over
with a long, long sigh.</p>

<p>Fleetfoot crept on tiptoe into the work-room
and without a sound untied a silver
bell from the neck of a drowsy white fur cat.</p>

<p>Then he and Jack Frost stole downstairs
and out of the house without being
seen by a single person except the friendly
Moon, who not only smiled as he watched
them, but followed them on their journey
all the way.</p>

<p>‘Now, we can talk,’ said Jack Frost,
as hand in hand they sped over the snow.
‘Let me tell you why I came after you
to-night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Brownie Fleetfoot nodded his red-capped
head. This was just what he
wanted to know, of course.</p>

<p>‘In the first place,’ began Jack Frost,
‘Buttons has lost Boots.’</p>

<p>Here he paused for a moment to shift
his paint-brush from one shoulder to the
other, but Fleetfoot was too wise to interrupt
by a question. He knew what
a sharp little fellow Jack Frost could be
if he wished.</p>

<p>‘Buttons is a little boy,’ went on Jack
Frost, taking a tight hold on Fleetfoot’s
hand. ‘He has a new winter coat trimmed
with brass buttons. And, too, his eyes
are as round as buttons and so are his
nose and his mouth. All this may be why
he is called Buttons. I can’t say. Boots
is his cat. It is easy to tell where he gets
his name, for he wears a white fur boot
on each foot.’</p>

<p>Brownie Fleetfoot didn’t answer, for at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
that moment he tumbled headlong into a
drift of snow. He lay there kicking until
Jack Frost pulled him out and gently
shook him to brush him off.</p>

<p>‘Try to keep your eyes open,’ said
Jack Frost, tweaking the end of Fleetfoot’s
nose. ‘And now come along. I was
in Buttons’ front yard to-night painting
his maple tree yellow and red,’ continued
Jack Frost, ‘and a very pretty tree it is
going to be. The night was as quiet as
quiet could be, not a sound, when, all of
a sudden, out of the door like a flash came
Boots and shot off round the house as fast
as he could go. He didn’t stop for anything.
I could hear the bell on his neck
tinkling all the way to the top of Butternut
Hill. That is a high hill just back of
Buttons’ house. Look out for that ice,
Fleetfoot! Do you want to tumble down?’</p>

<p>The little Brownie laughed and shook
his head. ‘It wouldn’t hurt me if I did,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
said saucy Fleetfoot, but under his breath
so that Jack Frost couldn’t hear.</p>

<p>‘In no time at all,’ went on Jack Frost,
‘out of the house came Buttons himself
in his night-clothes and no slippers,
enough to give him his death of cold.
And he started to hunt for Boots.’</p>

<p>‘It is lucky his mother didn’t see him,’
said Fleetfoot. ‘You know how particular
mothers are about coats and sweaters
and rubbers and all.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know,’ answered Jack Frost
shortly. Perhaps he thought it was
partly his fault that mothers behaved so.
At any rate, he didn’t seem pleased.
‘Don’t interrupt, Fleetfoot. Of course
Buttons hadn’t heard the bell going up
Butternut Hill, so where does he go to
look for Boots but round the barn. He
thought Boots was after mice, I suppose.
Well, I did my best to make Buttons
go up Butternut Hill. I whispered in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
ear, but he couldn’t understand a word
I said. He thought I was the wind blowing.
Think of that! Then I rubbed my
icicle over his nose and gave his cheeks
and his toes a little pinch. But that
didn’t help either. He kept walking
round and round the barn calling, “Boots!
Boots!” and saying, “Ouch!” every
time he stepped on a sharp stone with
his bare feet.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Buttons!’ murmured Fleetfoot,
looking down at his own pointed Brownie
shoes that were helping him speed so
swiftly over the ground. ‘Poor Buttons!
He must have hurt his toes.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, he did,’ answered Jack Frost, a
trifle sharply. ‘But I couldn’t help that,
you know. Now I am so busy this Autumn
weather that I couldn’t spend any
more time on him. So I hurried up Butternut
Hill, and there at the top, huddled
in a tree, sat Boots. The foolish fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
had dreamed that a dog was chasing him.
I heard him say so, talking to himself.
There he sat and wouldn’t come down.
Dream or no dream, he was afraid that
the dog was at the foot of the hill. I
pinched him and nipped him on ears and
nose and toes, but still he wouldn’t move
for me. I find that cats never are friendly
with me,’ said Jack Frost thoughtfully,
and a trifle sadly, too. ‘They are too fond
of the fire and their comfort to like me
very well.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ answered Fleetfoot, trying
to be both honest and kind; ‘but you
mustn’t mind that, you know. Think how
fond of you our reindeer are, and all the
Polar Bears. But what is it you want
me to do, Jack Frost? You said you had
brought me down here to help.’</p>

<p>‘We must send Buttons back to bed
as soon as we can,’ was Jack Frost’s answer.
‘I am a little worried about him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
He will catch a cold, I am afraid, out in
his night-clothes this frosty night. And
this is how I want you to help. I thought
you could play you were Boots, Fleetfoot.
You Brownies can do anything, I
know. You could ring your bell and run
on ahead and lead Buttons straight up
Butternut Hill to where the real Boots
sits in a tree. I chose you, Fleetfoot, because
you could run so lightly and so
fast. Once Buttons has found Boots, he
will carry him home to bed. There isn’t
anything else that he can do. And that
will be the end of it, I hope. Just think
of my being so busy to-night and having
to stop for a boy and a cat.’</p>

<p>Here Jack Frost shook his paint-brush
so impatiently that Fleetfoot skipped
along at his side faster than ever before.</p>

<p>‘Don’t I hear Buttons calling?’ asked
Fleetfoot presently, as they stopped a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
moment for breath. ‘I hear some one
calling, “Boots! Boots! Boots!”’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that is Buttons’ voice,’ answered
Jack Frost; ‘I hear him too. Now I will
keep out of the way, for I am afraid of
giving Buttons a chill, and you lead him
up the hill to Boots as fast as you can go.’</p>

<p>All this seemed great fun to Fleetfoot.
He watched the little figure in white
creeping round and round the barn calling,
‘Boots! Boots! Come home, Boots!’
Then he pulled from his pocket the silver
bell he had taken from the neck of the
drowsy white fur cat.</p>

<p>Tinkle! Tinkle! Tinkle!</p>

<p>Fleetfoot crouched close to the ground
and rang the bell at Buttons’ feet.</p>

<p>‘Boots!’ called Buttons with a little
jump. ‘Where are you? I hear your
bell.’</p>

<p>‘Tinkle! Tinkle! Tinkle!’ called the
bell a little farther away, and as Buttons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
started toward it, Fleetfoot cried,
‘Me-ow!’ in such a natural way that it
is no wonder Buttons felt sure it was the
voice of the missing Boots.</p>

<p>Round the barn and round the house
they went, the bell calling, ‘Tinkle! Tinkle!
Tinkle!’ and Buttons following close
behind. Up Butternut Hill they climbed,
Buttons quite forgetting his tender toes
in his eagerness to catch his little friend.
Up and up they went. Every time that
Fleetfoot cried, ‘Me-ow!’ Buttons would
run faster than before.</p>

<p>At last the top of the hill was reached
and Fleetfoot and Buttons both spied
Boots sitting on the branch of a tree, his
eyes gleaming in the darkness like green
lamps and every hair standing straight
out with excitement and fright.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Boots! Boots!’ cried Buttons,
standing at the foot of the tree and
stretching up his arms. ‘Come down!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Come down! We are all alone. There
is no one here but me.’</p>

<p>Fleetfoot wanted to laugh as he peeped
from behind the roots of the tree. All
alone, were they? Not to mention himself,
over the top of a bayberry bush
Fleetfoot could see the white plume in
Jack Frost’s cap. He had followed
them all the way up the hill. Indeed,
Boots and Buttons were not alone.</p>

<p>But neither Jack Frost nor Fleetfoot
stirred nor made a sign. They both
wanted Boots and Buttons to run home
at once.</p>

<p>Slowly down the trunk of the tree crept
Boots. Tenderly he was gathered into
Buttons’ arms. Down the hill started
Buttons on his way toward home.</p>

<p>Close behind them came Fleetfoot
watching Buttons’ every step.</p>

<p>‘Dear me, those bare toes!’ thought he to
himself. ‘How I wish he was safe at home!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Every time Buttons stepped on a stone
and cried, ‘Ouch!’ Fleetfoot winced as
if his own tiny toes had been hurt.
Brownies are the kindest little people in
the world and their hearts are very tender,
you must know.</p>

<p>Behind them, lurking in the shadows,
marched Jack Frost, carrying his paint-brush
like a banner, and stopping now and
then to paint a scarlet spray on a bush or
to trace with white the leaves of a late
wayside flower. Jack Frost felt happy.
He had been troubled about Buttons,
wandering out in his night-clothes on this
frosty night. But now, with the help of
Fleetfoot, he had started Buttons toward
home. In five minutes, if Buttons kept
straight on, the little boy would be tucked
snugly in his own warm bed.</p>

<p>But Buttons didn’t keep straight on.
Suddenly, to every one’s surprise, he sat
down by the side of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>‘Ouch! Ouch!’ cried Buttons, rocking
to and fro. ‘I have hurt my toe again.
Ouch! Ouch! Oh! Oh! I can’t walk
another step. Let us stay here, Boots,
and go to sleep. I am so tired. We can
go home in the morning.’</p>

<p>And burying his face in Boots’ fur,
poor, tired Buttons fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>‘This won’t do! This won’t do!’
scolded Jack Frost, hurrying up and
shaking his paint-brush as if he would
sweep Boots and Buttons down the road.
‘This will never do! Come, Fleetfoot,
come! We must get home at once.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ answered Fleetfoot soothingly,
sitting down beside Buttons and
quickly pulling off his own pointed
Brownie shoes. ‘See, Jack Frost, I will
put my own Brownie shoes on Buttons’
feet. Just like this. Now I will pull Boots
down on the ground and climb on his
back, so. Whoa, Boots, whoa! Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Jack Frost, take your icicle and poke
Buttons until he wakes. Wake up, Buttons,
wake up! Open your eyes! Good!
Now, let’s run!’</p>

<p>And, sure enough, off they started.
Boots ran like the wind, his bell all
a-tinkle, his ears pointing skyward, his
tail and his whiskers standing out
straight. On his back rode Fleetfoot,
holding on by the cat’s collar, and ringing
his own bell wildly as he rode. Behind
them sped Buttons, the Brownie shoes
carrying him over the ground faster than
he had ever run before. Close at his side
came Jack Frost, poking him with his
icicle now and then, though there wasn’t
the slightest need.</p>

<p>It was the funniest race the silver
Moon had ever looked down upon. No
wonder he laughed until the stars all
crowded round to see too.</p>

<p>Home at last! Jack Frost gave a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
sigh of relief as Buttons vanished into the
house and up the stairs to bed. Boots like
a shadow ran at his heels.</p>

<p>‘Just a moment,’ said Jack Frost, as he
and Fleetfoot stared up at the dark and
silent house, ‘until I see that they are
really safe.’</p>

<p>Like a flash Jack Frost disappeared,
and when he came back, as suddenly as
he had gone, his face was all a-smile.</p>

<p>‘Fast asleep already,’ said he. ‘They
were both tired out. Now, Fleetfoot, you
must go home. You had better ride back
on the Wind, I think. You have run
enough for one night. Tell Santa Claus
you were a great help. I never could
have got those two home if it hadn’t been
for you. Good-bye! I must go back to
work. This maple tree isn’t half finished.
Look at the green leaves I must paint
to-night.’</p>

<p>Jack Frost with a flourish of his paint-brush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> 
disappeared among the maple
boughs as Fleetfoot climbed upon the
shoulder of the friendly West Wind.</p>

<p>They were halfway home, sweeping
along through the air, when Fleetfoot
suddenly cried out.</p>

<p>‘My shoes!’ cried Fleetfoot. ‘My
shoes! I have left them on Buttons’ feet.
What will Buttons think in the morning
when he sees my Brownie shoes?’</p>

<p>The West Wind didn’t answer. Perhaps
he didn’t know what to say. As for
the Moon, he was still smiling. He made
Fleetfoot smile too.</p>

<p>‘That is the best thing to do,’ said
Fleetfoot. ‘Laugh about it. Probably
that is what Buttons will do to-morrow
morning when he sees my funny shoes.’</p>

<p>And Fleetfoot was right. That is just
what Buttons did.</p>

CHILDREN</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a little boy whom every
one called the Little Brown Boy. This
was because his name was Brown and
because his hair and his eyes were dark
brown, too.</p>

<p>Of course he had another name, indeed,
he had two—William John. But no
one except his mother and father, and his
aunts and uncles, and the minister, when
he came to tea, ever called him anything
but the Little Brown Boy.</p>

<p>One night the Little Brown Boy lay in
bed as wide awake as ever he could be.
He had been so sleepy when his mother
put him to bed that he couldn’t stand up
straight to take off his clothes. But once
tucked in bed and his mother gone downstairs,
the Little Brown Boy’s eyes flew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
open and he felt as lively as if it were
morning instead of his usual bed-time,
seven o’clock.</p>

<p>The Little Brown Boy looked from his
bed out of the open window at the tree-tops
that were tossing and nodding in a
gay West Wind. Down from the trees
whirled the Autumn leaves, red and
yellow and russet-brown, flying and falling
here and there, rustling where they
fell.</p>

<p>Bump! Bump! Bump!</p>

<p>The Little Brown Boy knew what that
sound meant. Nuts were blowing off the
great walnut tree that stood over the way
from the Little Brown Boy’s house.</p>

<p>Whisk! Scrabble! Rush!</p>

<p>That was a squirrel traveling over the
roof, as the Little Brown Boy well knew.</p>

<p>In the next room, through the half-open
door, the Little Brown Boy could
see his toys lying about on the floor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
There was his Jack-in-the-Box, looking
very uncomfortable, indeed, with his head
hanging over the side of the box almost
touching the ground. There was his
Jumping Jack, tossed in a corner, arms
and legs stretched out to jump, and a
tired look upon his little painted face. A
company of smart red-and-blue tin soldiers
lay in an untidy heap, face down,
their Captain buried underneath them all.
You wouldn’t dream that they were soldiers
if you didn’t see their uniforms and
swords and guns. There was a gray
horse and a scarlet wagon, both standing
on their heads. There were fire-engines,
topsy-turvy, scattered here and there. A
Mother Goose picture-book lay under a
chair, and if you had been close by you
would have seen that Mother Goose on
the cover did not seem at all pleased at
finding herself in such a place.</p>

<p>What was the matter with this play-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> 
that the toys lay scattered about on
the floor? Why were they not put neatly
away in closet and cupboard and drawer?</p>

<p>I will tell you.</p>

<p><i>The Little Brown Boy never, never
put away his toys!</i></p>

<p>His mother talked and scolded and
even shut him in the closet now and then.
His father shook his head and said to his
mother, ‘Well, I shall have to leave this
to you.’ His pretty Aunt Jeannie said
she would give him a present if only he
would put away his toys every night. His
tall Uncle Joe promised to take him to the
circus if he would pick up his playthings
for a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="He simply would not put away his toys!"></div>

<p>But nothing did any good. Not talking
nor scolding, for the Little Brown Boy
didn’t listen. Not shutting in the closet
nor even going to bed in the middle of
the day, for no sooner was he out at play
again than the Little Brown Boy had forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
all about it. Nothing was of any
use. He simply would not put away his
toys!</p>

<p>Now, as the Little Brown Boy lay
snug in his bed, something very strange
indeed happened to him. In at the open
window came the gay West Wind with
a laugh and a loud, loud puff!!! In a
twinkling he whirled the Little Brown
Boy out of bed, twirled him out of the
window, and then blew him along
through the air at such a pace that for a
moment the Little Brown Boy scarcely
knew just who or where he was.</p>

<p>When at last he could look about him
he found he was sitting on an Autumn
leaf, holding tight with both hands, and
riding along through the air so fast that
the Wind whistled past his ears.</p>

<p>‘Where am I going?’ called the Little
Brown Boy to the Wind. ‘Where am I
going? Tell me, do!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="The Wind blew him along through the air"></div>

<p>But the Wind only shouted ‘Whoo-oo-oo!’
and blew the little boy along
faster than ever before.</p>

<p>The big round Moon laughed down
at the Little Brown Boy. The Stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
twinkled and gleamed as if they were
laughing too.</p>

<p>On and on went the Autumn leaf,
whirling and twirling and dancing along
until the Little Brown Boy spied a great
snow-white Palace just ahead. Straight
to this Palace the Wind blew the Autumn
leaf. Down, down, down whirled the leaf
until it rested on the Palace front steps.
And then, of course, there was nothing
for the Little Brown Boy to do but to
jump off the leaf and look about him.</p>

<p>The ground was covered all roundabout
with snow, smooth, hard, shining
snow, but, strangely enough, in spite of
his bare toes, the Little Brown Boy didn’t
feel cold at all. Perhaps he was too excited.
I don’t know. He stared with wide-open
eyes at the great snow-white Palace,
glittering in the moonlight. Then
over to a half-open window, from which
streamed a rosy light, crept the Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Brown Boy, and, clinging to the window-sill,
he peeped into the room.</p>

<p>What the Little Brown Boy saw inside
the room almost made him tumble backward
into the snow.</p>

<p>For, before his very eyes sat Santa
Claus, the Santa Claus whose picture the
Little Brown Boy had seen many, many
times, and who, for as many years as the
Little Brown Boy could remember, had
crept down his chimney on Christmas
Eve and left him toys of all sorts and
kinds. Roundabout Santa Claus sat his
Brownies, his gay little helpers and toy-makers,
and they were listening carefully
to every word that Santa Claus had to
say. On a table, in front of the fire,
there lay a great open Book, and from
that Book, so it seemed to the Little
Brown Boy, Santa Claus was reading
children’s names.</p>

<p>‘Caroline Jones,’ read Santa Claus aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>‘A very good girl,’ he added. ‘She
minds her mother and goes to bed every
night without crying.’</p>

<p>When they heard this the Brownies
shouted, ‘Hurrah! Hurrah!’ and clapped
their hands. They seemed as pleased
as pleased could be to hear this news of
Caroline Jones.</p>

<p>Santa Claus bent over the Book again.</p>

<p>‘Tom Robinson,’ read Santa Claus
aloud.</p>

<p>‘A better boy than he was a month
ago,’ said he, looking round with a smile.
‘He is polite to his grandmother, and
runs errands without grumbling, and
cleans his finger nails, sometimes, without
being told.’</p>

<p>‘Good! Good!’ shouted the Brownies.
And again they clapped their tiny hands.</p>

<p>At the next name Santa Claus looked
sober and not a single Brownie smiled.</p>

<p>‘Johnny Smith,’ read Santa Claus, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
with a shake of the head, he dipped his
pen into a bottle of black, black ink.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="Santa Claus was reading children’s names"></div>

<p>‘He still worries the cat in spite of all
that has been said to him, and I hear he
has been poking his mother’s canary bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
with a stick.’ Santa Claus’s merry face
was now very sober indeed. ‘His name
must be crossed out, though I don’t like
to do it.’</p>

<p>And with his long pen Santa Claus
slowly drew a heavy black line through
the name ‘Johnny Smith.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Oh!’ sighed the Brownies, shaking
their heads. ‘Too bad! Too bad!’</p>

<p>‘He will have nothing in his stocking
next Christmas but a lump of coal,’ said
one Brownie in a low voice to his neighbor.</p>

<p>‘And an apple with a bite in it,’ added
another Brownie, looking sad.</p>

<p>‘But if he is a good boy between now
and Christmas, you will put his name back
in the Book of Good Children, won’t you,
Santa Claus?’ asked several Brownies,
eager to be as hopeful as they could.</p>

<p>The Little Brown Boy did not hear
Santa Claus’s answer. The Book of Good
Children! So that is what it was all about!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
The Little Brown Boy held tightly to the
window-sill and almost put his head into
the room.</p>

<p>Of course he knew what the Book of
Good Children was. We all do. The
Book in which Santa Claus keeps the
names of all the Children whom he is to
visit on Christmas Eve. What surprised
the Little Brown Boy was that Santa
Claus had actually crossed out a little
boy’s name from his Book. Though his
mother had often warned him just before
Christmas that this might happen to him,
he had never believed that Santa Claus
would do such a thing.</p>

<p>But now Santa Claus was reading again
from his great thick Book. And at what
he heard the Little Brown Boy could
scarcely believe his ears.</p>

<p>‘Dear! Dear!’ Santa Claus was saying.
‘Here is another name that must be
crossed out.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>And slowly and sadly Santa Claus read
the name aloud.</p>

<p>‘The Little Brown Boy!’ read he.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, Santa Claus!’ called out all
the Brownies, their kind little faces quite
wrinkled with distress. ‘Don’t cross out
his name to-night. Give him another
chance. Perhaps he will learn to pick
up his toys. Don’t cross off his name
to-night.’</p>

<p>Before Santa Claus could answer or
even lay down his pen, there was a noise
from the window that made Santa Claus
and the Brownies jump to their feet.
Over the window-sill rose the head of a
little boy. His eyes were round as buttons
with fright, his mouth was open to
call, ‘No! No! No!’ and every single
hair stood straight on end with excitement,
which, as you may imagine, gave
him a very strange look indeed.</p>

<p>The next moment the little boy, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
was dressed in his night-clothes, came
scrambling through the half-open window
into the room. Straight to Santa
Claus he ran and clasped him round his
great high boots.</p>

<p>‘No! No! No!’ called out the little
boy again, squeezing Santa Claus’s boots
close in his arms. ‘Don’t cross out my
name! I will be good! I will put away my
toys every night! Don’t leave a coal in
my stocking at Christmas! Don’t give
me an apple with a bite! Oh! Oh! Oh!’</p>

<p>Here the little boy could say no more,
for he hadn’t a speck of breath left.</p>

<p>‘Well, well, well,’ said Santa Claus,
sitting down and lifting the little boy to
his knee, ‘it is the Little Brown Boy
himself, I do declare.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ nodded the Little Brown Boy
with a sniff, ‘and I am going to put away
my toys every night after this. I promise
you, Santa Claus. I promise I will.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>‘Good!’ answered Santa Claus heartily.
‘Good! Your name is still in the Book.
It isn’t crossed off yet. See for yourself.’</p>

<p>And there, in Santa Claus’s own Book
of Good Children, the Little Brown Boy,
leaning from Santa Claus’s knee, saw his
name written as plain as plain could be.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you take him up to see
the toys?’ suggested Santa Claus to his
Brownies, who were now smiling and
nodding at one another and hopping
about.</p>

<p>So upstairs they went to a great room
filled to every corner with toys very much
like those the Little Brown Boy had at
home.</p>

<p>At their first glimpse of the Little
Brown Boy, the toys became excited, so
excited that the Little Brown Boy held
fast to the Brownies’ hands. For the toys
began to call out and all talk at once and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
tell the Little Brown Boy just how toys
felt when they were left lying on the floor
at night.</p>

<p>‘We want to rest in our own stable
and not lie out in the cold,’ whinnied the
horses, stamping their feet and tossing
their heads as they spoke.</p>

<p>‘We like to be packed neatly in our
box,’ said the tin soldiers, giving the
Little Brown Boy a fine salute. ‘It is so
untidy and unlike a soldier to lie about
on the floor.’</p>

<p>‘We can’t drive straight and with
speed to a fire,’ spoke out the firemen,
growing red in the face, ‘unless our fire-engines
are placed in a row on the shelf.
You must understand how that is yourself.’</p>

<p>The Little Brown Boy nodded. He
did begin to understand.</p>

<p>‘My legs grow stiff when I lie on the
floor,’ complained the Jumping Jack, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
an injured look. ‘I can’t jump so well.
Could you?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ murmured the Little Brown Boy,
hanging his head and almost putting his
finger in his mouth, but not quite.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a crick I have in my neck!’
said the Jack-in-the-Box, making a comical
face, ‘unless I am put in my box with
the cover fastened down tight.’</p>

<p>And the Jack-in-the-Box crouched
down and then gave a mighty spring
into the air as if to show that he had no
crick in his neck at the present time.</p>

<p>As for Mother Goose on the picture-book,
she shook her finger at the Little
Brown Boy, but she forgave him with a
smile, as did all the toys, when he promised
them solemnly, just as he had
promised Santa Claus, that he would put
his toys neatly away every night.</p>

<p>‘I won’t forget,’ said the Little Brown
Boy. ‘I promise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>The Brownies were so happy when
they heard this that they said, ‘Let’s
have a feast.’</p>

<p>So sitting round the fire, with Santa
Claus looking on, they all roasted chestnuts
and popped corn, the Little Brown
Boy too. And they ate and they ate
and they ate until they couldn’t eat any
more.</p>

<p>Never before, so he thought, had the
Little Brown Boy had such a good time.
But at last it was the Brownies’ bed-time,
and the Little Brown Boy on his leaf
was whirled swiftly and safely home.</p>

<p>When he woke in the morning the
first thing he did was to pick up all his
toys and put them neatly away. And
once in their proper places, the toys all
gave a sigh of relief and fell fast asleep,
they were so worn out from lying on the
floor.</p>

<p>Then the Little Brown Boy crept into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
his mother’s bed and told her all that had
happened to him the night before.</p>

<p>‘What do you think of that?’ asked
the Little Brown Boy when he had finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="The Little Brown Boy crept into his mother’s bed"></div>

<p>He was much surprised to have his
mother answer, ‘I think it was all a
dream.’</p>

<p>‘A dream?’ exclaimed the Little Brown
Boy. ‘How can it be a dream? Look
here!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>From the pocket in his night-clothes
he pulled a chestnut, a roasted chestnut
that the Brownies had given to him last
night.</p>

<p>‘How can it be a dream?’ asked the
Little Brown Boy again.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ answered his mother.
‘Perhaps it did happen. At any rate, I
am glad that, after this, you are going to
pick up your toys every night.’</p>

<p>‘I am,’ said the Little Brown Boy with
a nod. ‘I promised Santa Claus.’</p>

<p>And I don’t have to tell you that the
Little Brown Boy kept his word.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BROWNIE WHO FOUND
CHRISTMAS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Merrythought</span> was tired of Christmas.</p>

<p>‘I can scarcely believe it,’ said Santa
Claus. ‘I never heard of such a thing
before.’</p>

<p>‘Neither did I,’ answered Merrythought,
shaking his head until the tip
of his scarlet cap wagged to and fro.
‘But it is true, Santa Claus. I am tired
of Christmas.’</p>

<p>Merrythought was a Brownie. He
was not only a Brownie, he was Santa
Claus’s very best workman as well. It
was Santa Claus himself who said so,
and surely he ought to know.</p>

<p>All the year round Merrythought sat
in the Snow Palace, at the very tip-top
of the North Pole, making toys for
Christmas—toys for boys, toys for girls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
toys for babies too, and no one but the
most skillful Brownie could have made
such beautiful, shining Christmas toys.
There is not the slightest doubt in the
world about that.</p>

<p>It was the week before Christmas and
all the other Brownies who help Santa
Claus stood together in a corner of the
work-room whispering about Merrythought
behind their hands.</p>

<p>‘To think that Merrythought is tired
of Christmas!’ said Brownie Kindheart,
who was in charge of the smallest baby
dolls because of his gentle, friendly way.
‘Why, I think Merrythought’s dolls are
the most beautiful of all. Their eyes are
the bluest, and their cheeks are the rosiest,
and their lips have the sweetest
smiles. I don’t see how Merrythought
can be tired of Christmas.’</p>

<p>‘He says he doesn’t like toys any
more,’ spoke up Nimbletoes, ‘but I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
saw such fine Jumping Jacks as he has
made this year. They leap and dance
and fling their arms and legs about until
I can scarcely stand still.’</p>

<p>And Nimbletoes jumped up and down
like a Jumping Jack till he lost his breath
and had to sit down in the corner to find
it again.</p>

<p>‘I like his Jack-in-the-Boxes immensely,’
said Brownie Mischief, smiling
at the very thought. ‘They shoot up in
the air with so much spirit and dash and
they all wear such cheerful grins. Each
one seems to say, “Don’t you wish you
were a Jack-in-the-Box?” And, I declare,
sometimes I almost do.’</p>

<p>‘Give me his rocking-horses,’ said
Fleetfoot, whose specialty was making
roller skates and snow coasters and kites.
‘They prance and gallop and champ at
their bits as if they would like nothing
better than to take you for a ride to Banbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Cross and back again. I think he is
the best toy-maker of us all.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Merrythought!’ whispered gentle
Silvertongue, pointing to the corner
where Merrythought sat alone. ‘How
sober he looks! He used to grow happier
and happier as Christmas drew near. He
would sing at his work and smile to himself
until the whole Snow Palace was in
a good humor no matter how busy we
might be.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ agreed Kindheart. ‘He
was as merry as his name. But he says
this year he has lost his feeling for
Christmas. He used to love it, the toys
and the candy and the surprises. But he
doesn’t feel so now. He thinks children
want too many toys. He has lost Christmas,
he says.’</p>

<p>‘Lost Christmas?’ exclaimed little
Sharpeyes, the errand boy. He was the
Brownie who picked up pins and threaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
needles and found the scissors for every
one else. ‘Perhaps I can find it for him. I
will begin to look this very minute. I
would look for a week without stopping
rather than have Merrythought feel so
sad.’</p>

<p>‘Ho! I know what to do!’ cried Sweet-Tooth,
chief of the candy cooks. ‘I will
make a new candy for Merrythought, a
new chewy kind, that will keep him so
busy he will forget that he has lost
Christmas. Now let me tell you Brownies
what I mean to put in it.’</p>

<p>Sweet-Tooth checked off the items on
his fingers while the Brownies crowded
round to hear.</p>

<p>‘Molasses—and sugar—and hickory
nuts—and cream——’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But Mischief slipped away and strolled
over to the work-bench where Merrythought
sat, his head on his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>‘What is the matter, Merrythought?’
asked Mischief kindly. ‘You look as if
you had lost your best friend.’</p>

<p>‘I have,’ answered Merrythought,
without raising his head, ‘or worse. I
have lost Christmas. I don’t like Christmas
any more.’</p>

<p>‘What is the matter with Christmas?’
asked Mischief again. ‘You used to like
Christmas the best of us all.’</p>

<p>‘I know I did,’ answered Merrythought,
‘but I have had too much of
it. I am tired of toys and presents and
Christmas Trees, and the very thought of
tinsel and silver and gold Tree ornaments
makes me shudder from head to foot.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me,’ said Mischief with a little
frown, ‘that is too bad. What you need
is a change, Merrythought. I am sure you
need a change. Why don’t you ask Santa
Claus to let you ride with him around the
world on Christmas Eve?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>‘He wouldn’t take me,’ answered
Merrythought, slowly shaking his head.
‘You know he always says that if he took
one Brownie he would have to take all,
and that if he took us all we would make
so much noise that we would wake the
children in their beds. I don’t want to
go, anyway. It would be nothing but
toys, toys, toys. That is all children
think of nowadays, at Christmas, how
many toys they are going to get.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe all children have so
many toys,’ said Mischief. ‘I think if you
went with Santa Claus you would see
some children who had very little Christmas
indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Humph, I don’t,’ answered Merrythought.
‘Think of that sleigh full of toys,
enough for the whole world. And I am
tired of toys, I tell you. I have made
only one toy this year that I really like,
and that is Lady Arabella.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>‘Oh, yes, Lady Arabella,’ said Mischief,
and walked off without another
word.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lady Arabella was a big little-girl doll,
and Merrythought had made her for little
Princess Maud.</p>

<p>It happened this way. Early in December,
Santa Claus had a letter from
Princess Maud’s grandmother in which
she said that she would like Princess
Maud to have a big little-girl doll for
Christmas this year. Santa Claus took
the letter to Merrythought, his best workman,
and Merrythought sat himself down
and made Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>Now Merrythought was so tired of
curly hair and lace dresses with satin
bows and pale blue kid shoes to match
that he didn’t give Lady Arabella any of
these. He thought to himself, ‘Perhaps
Princess Maud is tired of fancy dresses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
too; perhaps she would like a plain comfortable
doll whose clothes she could not
spoil no matter how hard she played with
her.’ So he gave Lady Arabella pretty
blue eyes and pink cheeks, to be sure, and
two long yellow braids tied with flyaway
pink bows. But he dressed her in neat
brown shoes and stockings and in a plain,
though fine, white frock. And over the
frock he put a pink-and-white pinafore
that covered her from top to toe, a good,
sensible pinafore that was not in the least
like a lace dress with satin bows and pale
blue kid shoes to match. The pinafore
had pockets and in one pocket was a tiny
handkerchief and in the other a purse
just large enough to hold a penny. Oh!
Merrythought knew how to do things
When it came to making dolls.</p>

<p>Now you might think that Lady Arabella
was too plain and sensible for a
Christmas doll. But there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
about her that every one liked. The toys
liked her, the Brownies liked her—you
remember that Merrythought liked her
best of all the toys he had made that year—and
Santa Claus felt sure that Princess
Maud and her grandmother would be delighted
with her, too.</p>

<p>Now when Mischief left Merrythought
he went looking for Lady Arabella, and
he found her seated on the window-sill
behind the curtain watching the reindeer
romping in the snow.</p>

<p>Mischief slipped behind the curtain too,
and first of all he asked Lady Arabella
if she had heard him talking to Merrythought
just now.</p>

<p>Yes, Lady Arabella had heard every
single word.</p>

<p>Then Mischief asked a very strange
question, indeed.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what a tantrum is, Lady
Arabella?’ asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>‘No, I never heard of a tantrum,’ said
Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>‘Well, a tantrum is this,’ explained
Mischief, his face very sober but his eyes
twinkling with fun. ‘You want your own
way, and you dance up and down and
scream and cry and sometimes you lie on
the floor and kick. Now, Lady Arabella,
do you think you could have a tantrum?’
asked he.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Lady Arabella promptly,
‘I am sure that I could.’</p>

<p>‘Then let me whisper in your ear,’ said
Mischief.</p>

<p>And when he had finished whispering,
he and Lady Arabella laughed and nodded
at one another and laughed again.</p>

<p>They had a secret, and presently you
shall know what it was.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was late afternoon on Christmas
Eve—the busiest moment in the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
year at Santa Claus’s Snow Palace on the
very tip-top of the North Pole.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="The Brownies packing the sleigh with toys"></div>

<p>The great sleigh stood in front of the
door, the eight tiny reindeer harnessed
and in place before it. In and out of the
Palace scurried the Brownies, packing
the sleigh with the toys they had been at
work upon for a long, long year.</p>

<p>Out came the trains, the wagons, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
sleds. Nimbletoes sped by with his arms
full of Teddy bears and Jumping Jacks.
Sweet-Tooth staggered along under his
load of candy, fifty different kinds. Silvertongue
carried toy cats and dogs,
elephants, sheep, and camels, too. Very
gently Kindheart brought out the dolls,
tucking them carefully into warm and
comfortable nooks. Mischief dragged
down the steps two rocking-horses at a
time, their manes and tails blowing in the
frosty air. Fleetfoot and Merrythought
were everywhere at once, tying a bicycle
on the back of the sleigh, pushing in a
stray Noah’s Ark, squeezing a Jack-in-the-Box
into place. Little by little the
sleigh was filled. Higher and higher grew
the pile of toys. It was more and more
difficult to find a place for each toy now.</p>

<p>Sharpeyes ran about, picking up the
last few toys that had been dropped here
and there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Merrythought stood by the reindeer,
rubbing Dasher’s head, patting Dancer
upon his furry nose.</p>

<p>Santa Claus drew on his gloves. It
was almost time to start.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mischief, whose face had
grown very red, called out, ‘Where is
Lady Arabella? We have forgotten Lady
Arabella.’</p>

<p>Every one looked at every one else. It
was true, quite true, they had forgotten
Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>Mischief, always as quick as a flash,
darted into the Palace, to come running
out again, holding Lady Arabella by the
hand.</p>

<p>‘I found her!’ called Mischief. ‘I found
her! She was hiding behind the curtain,
on the window-sill. But, look, Santa
Claus, she is crying! Lady Arabella is
crying!’</p>

<p>And so it was. Lady Arabella was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
crying. In spite of her tiny handkerchief
which she pulled from her pinafore pocket,
the tears ran down her pretty pink cheeks
and the end of her little tip-tilted nose
was red.</p>

<p>The Brownies stared at Lady Arabella,
and Santa Claus stared too. Such a thing
as a crying doll had never happened before.
The toys were always happy and
excited on Christmas Eve, looking forward
to their new homes, wherever Santa
Claus might leave them.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Lady Arabella?’
asked Santa Claus in his kindest voice.
‘Have you a pain? Are you hungry?
What is the matter with you?’</p>

<p>‘I am homesick,’ sobbed Lady Arabella.
‘I am homesick and lonely too. I
don’t want to go riding all aloney-loney-loney.
I want Merrythought to go with
me. I do, I do, I do!’</p>

<p>‘But you will not be alone,’ said Santa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Claus in surprise. ‘There is a nice place
for you beside Red Jumping Jack. Look
and see! He will hold one hand and the
White Polar Bear will hold the other. I
am sure you will not be lonely if only you
make up your mind not to cry.’</p>

<p>But Lady Arabella shook her head and
danced up and down and cried louder
than before.</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ cried Lady Arabella, shaking
her elbows as if she would like to poke
the Red Jumping Jack and the White
Polar Bear. ‘I want Merrythought! I
want Merrythought to go with me or else
I won’t go at all.’</p>

<p>Here Lady Arabella threw herself on
the ground and kicked with all her might
and main. You could scarcely see her
brown shoes and stockings, Lady Arabella
kicked them to and fro so very fast.</p>

<p>A strange way, indeed, for Lady Arabella
to act! It didn’t seem at all like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
doll who had been made to live with a
little Princess. Surely such a doll would
be on her best behavior every moment
of the time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="Lady Arabella threw herself on the ground"></div>

<p>But you would have thought it still
more strange if you could have seen Mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
hiding down behind the sleigh. All
of the other Brownies were so sorry for
Lady Arabella that they looked quite
troubled; one or two of them looked quite
shocked. But Mischief was not troubled
at all. He almost seemed trying not to
laugh. He was muttering to himself as
well, and Silvertongue said afterward
that he thought he heard him say, ‘Hurrah
for you, Lady Arabella! That is a
good tantrum. That is one of the best
tantrums I have ever seen.’</p>

<p>Now Santa Claus was like the Brownies.
He was troubled to see Lady Arabella
so unhappy. It was growing late,
too.</p>

<p>‘Dear me!’ said Santa Claus, rubbing
his nose with his great fur glove. ‘Dear
me! Little Princess Maud won’t want a
doll who has been crying. Perhaps you
had better jump in, Merrythought, and
go with us, after all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>‘Yes, sir,’ answered Merrythought.</p>

<p>His breath was quite taken away at
the idea of going round the world with
Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. But he
managed to raise Lady Arabella to her
feet and together they quickly climbed
into place in the sleigh.</p>

<p>Mischief tucked the robe round Lady
Arabella and patted her hand. Santa
Claus gathered up the reins, he cracked
his whip, the Brownies gave three loud
cheers, and the sleigh was off.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella still behaved strangely.
She wiped her eyes and smiled round
at Merrythought. She was not at all
ashamed of having had a tantrum, though
the Red Jumping Jack and the White
Polar Bear gave her a scornful look.
Then she hid her face on Merrythought’s
shoulder and laughed and laughed and
laughed. And not until they were well
out of sight of the palace was she able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
sit around straight and look about her as
she rode.</p>

<p>Now have you guessed the secret that
Lady Arabella and Mischief had between
them? Just think a moment and I am
sure you will.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On sped the sleigh over the snow, the
moon and the stars glittering cold and
bright in the frosty sky. Snow, snow,
still more snow. Then the forests, dark
and piney and sweet-smelling. Now and
then a house. Up, up, up to the roof
would go the sleigh, down the chimney
Santa Claus would creep, then back
again to his place and off, the reindeer
seeming fairly to fly over the snow. Now
a village, now a town.</p>

<p>And everywhere children in bed and
asleep, their bedrooms dark or dimly
lighted by a low night-lamp. And everywhere
ready and waiting for Santa Claus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
though not always ready in just the same
way. Sometimes there would be stockings
hung by the chimney place, sometimes
a little wooden shoe placed outside
the door, sometimes a candle burning in
the window to light Noel upon his way.
But always Santa Claus knew what to
do and just what presents to leave in
every house.</p>

<p>Into a big city dashed the sleigh,
straight toward a great castle with turrets
and towers and many windows sparkling
in the frosty starlight. It was the castle
where Princess Maud lived, and now
Merrythought and Lady Arabella were
forced to say good-bye.</p>

<p>‘I know you will make Princess Maud
happy,’ said Merrythought, kissing Lady
Arabella’s pretty pink cheek.</p>

<p>In return Lady Arabella threw both
arms about Merrythought’s neck.</p>

<p>‘I’m so glad that you could come with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
us,’ whispered she, hugging him close,
‘and do try to find Christmas again to-night
if you can.’</p>

<p>Then down the chimney went Lady
Arabella and Santa Claus and the great
pack of toys into the peaceful night
nursery where slept the little Princess
Maud, dreaming of the big little-girl doll
she hoped Santa Claus would bring her
that night.</p>

<p>On went the sleigh. Merrythought
crept next to Santa Claus and cuddled
down close as the sleigh swept across
the ocean with its dashing waves and
snow squalls and great ships ploughing
silently along through the black and icy
water.</p>

<p>There were children on those ships.
Do you think Santa Claus passed them
by? Not he! By special arrangement
down on the decks he flung great sacks
of toys so that no child should wake on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Christmas Morning and find his stocking
unfilled.</p>

<p>Over the land again, Santa Claus stopping
so often now that Merrythought
grew quite used to holding the reins.
Here were more children fast asleep,
here were mothers and fathers trimming
Christmas Trees, and people trudging
through the snow carrying presents and
wreaths of holly and bunches of mistletoe.</p>

<p>‘Gay, isn’t it?’ asked Santa Claus,
smiling with all his might. ‘There is
nothing in the world quite like Christmas
and plenty of toys for every one. Eh,
Merrythought?’</p>

<p>And his face was so happy as he looked
down at Merrythought that the little
Brownie was ashamed to tell him how
he really felt.</p>

<p>So he buried his nose in the warm
fur robe and only mumbled something
about ‘too many toys.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>But Santa Claus heard him and understood.
He didn’t speak again to Merrythought.
He only looked at him when
they reached a poor house where all Santa
Claus left for the little boy was a fire-engine,
and next door where the baby
had only a monkey-on-a-stick.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps all children don’t have too
many toys,’ thought Merrythought. ‘But
they all have something. And I am tired to
death of toys, just tired to death of them.’</p>

<p>Now Santa Claus drove through the
white countryside, on and on and on,
until there was not a house to be seen.</p>

<p>‘Where can we be going?’ Merrythought
asked himself. ‘This looks like
the end of the world.’</p>

<p>On and on and on, until, half buried in
the snow, Merrythought spied a little
brown house. There was a light in the
window, though it was the middle of the
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>‘Somebody trimming a Christmas
Tree, I suppose,’ thought Merrythought.
‘More toys and tinsel and gold, no doubt.’</p>

<p>To his surprise Santa Claus did not
stop. He slowed up a little and gently,
very gently, he lifted Merrythought out
and dropped him in the snow.</p>

<p>‘Go look in the window,’ said Santa
Claus, ‘and if I am not mistaken there
will be something for you to see. I will
be back for you by and by.’</p>

<p>And off sped the sleigh and out of sight
among the white drifts of snow.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Merrythought struggled up the path
through the deep snow and peeped in the
window.</p>

<p>As we know, he had expected to see a
Christmas Tree laden with gay balls and
chains and ornaments of every kind and
hue. He thought he might see stockings
in a row. He was sure he would see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
bunches of holly and sprays of mistletoe.</p>

<p>But the room into which he looked had
not a sign of Christmas anywhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="Merrythought peeped in the window"></div>

<p>It was a bare little room with a bed in
one corner and an old cook-stove that
quite filled one side of the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>And in the room were seven children,
all wide awake as could be, just as if it
were not Christmas Eve, when every wise
little boy or girl goes to sleep the moment
his bed-time comes. The seven children
were in their night-gowns, all but one, the
oldest, a girl, and they had huddled round
their shoulders bits of shawls and blankets
to keep them warm. But in spite of
this and the fire in the stove their noses
were red with cold and they blew upon
their fingers every now and then.</p>

<p>They were watching the stove, the
oven of the stove, and all seven were
sniffing, sniffing the air. And first one and
then the other would call out, ‘I smell
them! I smell them! I know I do!’</p>

<p>At this they would become so excited
that they would jump up and down and lose
off their blankets and bits of shawls. Then
the biggest girl would have to go round
among them and wrap them up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>All this Merrythought could hear and
see quite plainly, for his nose was pressed
flat against the window-pane.</p>

<p>‘They must have a Christmas Turkey
in the oven,’ thought he. ‘But what a
strange time to cook it. And where are
their toys and their Tree and their father
and mother, too?’</p>

<p>Merrythought looked and listened with
all his might.</p>

<p>‘I must know what is in that oven,’
thought he again. ‘It doesn’t smell like
turkey to me.’</p>

<p>Here Merrythought sniffed vigorously
all along the window-sill. He was becoming
almost as excited as the children
themselves.</p>

<p>‘I will know their names soon,’ said he,
smiling to see the seven children sniff and
clap their hands and jump about. ‘That
oldest girl is named Belinda, for the other
children are always calling out, “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Belinda, wrap me up! Oh, Belinda, do
sniff over here!” She seems to take care
of them. I wonder where their own
mother is.’</p>

<p>Merrythought rubbed the steam of his
breath off the window and peered in
again.</p>

<p>‘The littlest boy with freckles is called
Tom, and the one with curls and her
thumb in her mouth is Matilda, and the
baby is Polly, I know. I think those two
boys holding hands and giggling are
called Danny and Bill. And the one with
the pigtails is named Ann Mary, for her
two grandmothers, I suppose. I wonder
when they will open that oven door and
take out whatever is inside.’</p>

<p>The children were wondering this, too.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Belinda, do look in the oven!
Oh, Belinda, do see if they are not done!
Oh, Belinda, we can’t wait a minute
longer!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="Belinda, do look in the oven!"></div>

<p>Belinda laughed at them and shook her
head.</p>

<p>Stand back,’ said she, ‘and I will look
in the oven.’</p>

<p>But they didn’t stand back, not they.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
They crowded round and peeked and
sniffed as Belinda gently opened the oven
door. And when she said, ‘They are
done!’ they clapped their hands and
shouted and pranced about the room.</p>

<p>‘What can it be?’ asked Merrythought,
clinging to the window-sill, his eyes as
round as plates. ‘It must be something
very rich and fine.’</p>

<p>But what do you think Belinda took
from the oven and carefully set upon the
table in a row?</p>

<p>Seven little pies! Seven little saucer
pies, in very small saucers, too!</p>

<p>Merrythought almost fell off the window-sill,
he was so surprised. And the
very next moment he did something much
worse. He sneezed! A loud crashing
sneeze that jerked his head forward and
struck it against the window-pane with a
thump!</p>

<p>Well, of course the children rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
over to the window to see what was there.
And when they saw a little fellow, only
Brownie size, they opened the door, and
Belinda called him to come in.</p>

<p>So in Merrythought went, and the
room was so sweet with the odor of the
seven little pies that Merrythought
couldn’t help sniffing and staring at them,
too.</p>

<p>‘They are our pies,’ spoke up little
Tom proudly.</p>

<p>‘One apiece,’ announced Danny and
Bill in a breath.</p>

<p>‘Belinda made them,’ said Ann Mary,
twitching her pigtails into place.</p>

<p>‘For our Christmas,’ added Matilda,
taking her thumb out of her mouth to say
so.</p>

<p>Baby Polly didn’t speak a word. Perhaps
she couldn’t. I am not sure about
that. But she toddled straight over to
Merrythought and slipped her hand in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
his. She knew at a glance that here was
a friend. And she was right. For unless
he were a good friend to little children
Merrythought could never have made
such beautiful playthings for them, in
spite of the fact that this Christmas he
had grown so tired of toys.</p>

<p>But, somehow, as he looked about the
little room, bare of Christmas on Christmas
Eve, Merrythought didn’t so dislike
the idea of toys. Indeed, it seemed all
wrong and strange not to see a shining
Tree and stockings, filled to overflowing,
in a row, and little heads, brown and black
and yellow, snuggled down into a pillow
and happy with Christmas dreams.</p>

<p>This was a strange Christmas Eve,
and perhaps Merrythought’s face showed
what he felt, for Belinda began at once
to tell him how it had come about.</p>

<p>‘You see, Father and Mother went to
town almost a week ago. Father went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
help build a house. He is a carpenter, you
know. And Mother went to do sewing for
the minister’s wife,’ said Belinda, standing
straight and tall. ‘And they left me to
take care of the children. They meant to
be home for Christmas. They were coming
to-night. Mother said she would bring
each of the children an orange, if she
could. But the snow is very deep, and
they didn’t come. So I made the pies for
the children. They have apples and molasses
and sugar in them. And the children
will like them just as well as toys.’</p>

<p>The children did like them. They were
hopping round the table and calling out,
‘Smell mine! Smell mine!’</p>

<p>But Merrythought did not like it at all.
He thought of the many toys he had made
that year in Santa Claus’s Snow Palace
on the very tip-top of the North Pole, he
thought of Santa Claus’s sleigh still well
filled, he thought of the stockings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Christmas Trees that other children would
enjoy on Christmas Day. And Merrythought
wished with all his generous little
Brownie heart that he could give a beautiful
toy to each of these seven children
who were made so happy on Christmas
by a little saucer pie.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ groaned Merrythought to himself.
‘And I said there were too many
toys. I said children thought of nothing
but toys and how many they would get.
I said I was tired of toys. And these
children haven’t a single one, not a single
little toy. How could I have said such a
thing! Oh! Oh! Oh!’</p>

<p>But here Merrythought felt some one
pulling at his hand.</p>

<p>It was Ann Mary, holding out her pie
to Merrythought.</p>

<p>‘Here!’ said Ann Mary, her pigtails
standing straight out with excitement.
‘Take it. It’s yours. I want to give it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
you for Christmas because you haven’t
any pie or anything. The other children
will give me bites of theirs. They said
they would. Take it. It’s for you.’</p>

<p>Merrythought took the pie. He almost
wanted to cry, but he took a bite of crust
instead.</p>

<p>‘Delicious!’ said Merrythought. ‘It is
the best pie I ever ate.’</p>

<p>But at that moment Merrythought’s
face grew very bright.</p>

<p>‘Just a minute,’ said he. ‘Don’t stir.’</p>

<p>He opened the door and looked out.
He listened and listened again.</p>

<p>Just as he thought. He did hear Santa
Claus’s sleigh-bells, faint and clear.</p>

<p>‘Wait! Wait for me!’ he shouted out
into the snow. And there came an answering
tinkle that told him Santa Claus
had heard.</p>

<p>Then he turned back into the room.</p>

<p>‘Think just as fast as you can,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Merrythought to the seven astonished
children standing before him in a row.
‘Think just as fast as you can, and then
tell me what toy you would like most of
all for Christmas.’</p>

<p>Why, it didn’t take them two minutes
to think. They began to answer before
Merrythought had finished speaking to
them.</p>

<p>‘A sled! A pair of skates!’ said Danny
and Bill, holding tight to one another and
giggling as they spoke.</p>

<p>‘A Jack-in-the-Box,’ said Tom, all
freckles and smiles.</p>

<p>‘A doll, a sleepy doll,’ said Ann Mary,
twitching her pigtails into place.</p>

<p>‘A Jumping Jack,’ said Matilda, taking
her thumb out of her mouth and putting
it back again.</p>

<p>Polly hid her face in Belinda’s skirt, so
Belinda answered for her.</p>

<p>‘She wants a woolly lamb on wheels,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
said Belinda. ‘I know that is what she
wants most of all.’</p>

<p>‘And what do you want?’ asked
Merrythought. ‘Every one has told but
you.’</p>

<p>Belinda’s eyes grew bright.</p>

<p>‘I want a sewing-box,’ said Belinda—‘a
sewing-box with a lock and key so
that the children can never touch what is
inside.’</p>

<p>Merrythought nodded. He could go
straight to work at once. He started toward
the door. Then suddenly he turned
back again.</p>

<p>‘But you mustn’t look!’ exclaimed
Merrythought. He had remembered how
dreadful it would be if any one peeped
out of the window and caught even a
glimpse of Santa Claus and his sleigh.
‘You mustn’t look, you know. Promise
me that not one of you will look.’</p>

<p>‘We will hide our eyes,’ said Belinda.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
‘Come, children. Let’s hide our eyes on
the side of the bed.’</p>

<p>So down by the side of the bed went
the seven children, all in a row, their
blankets and bits of shawls huddled round
their shoulders and their pink toes and
heels showing in the most comical way.
They didn’t know what it was all about,
to be sure, but it was Christmasy and
fun and exciting, and they liked it, every
one.</p>

<p>Then Merrythought, his pie in his
hand, rushed out of the house to be met
by Santa Claus, with both arms full,
down at the gate.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I know all about it,’ said
Santa Claus, ruddy and smiling, with
little icicles hanging from his beard.
‘Here, help me with these toys. This is
Danny’s sled, a red one. Put it on the
doorstep and pile these blankets on top.
Don’t let them fall in the snow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>‘Blankets?’ said Merrythought in surprise.
‘Nobody wants blankets here.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, they do,’ answered Santa
Claus firmly. ‘Their mother does.
Didn’t you see how thin their blankets
were?’</p>

<p>Merrythought stared at Santa Claus.
There was no one in the world quite like
him, after all.</p>

<p>‘Here are Bill’s skates and Belinda’s
sewing-box with a lock and key,’ went
on Santa Claus, reaching down first into
one deep pocket and then into the other.
‘Put them on top of the blankets. And
here is Ann Mary’s sleepy doll. You
made her, Merrythought. She is one of
your prettiest. This is Tom’s Jack-in-the-Box.
What’s this? Oh, Matilda’s
Jumping Jack. How he can jump! And
here is Polly’s woolly lamb on green
wheels with a bell round his neck. Now,
just a little candy,’ finished Santa Claus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
packing seven boxes neatly on the edge
of the sled, ‘and we are off.’</p>

<p>Into the sleigh, fairly empty now,
climbed Merrythought and Santa Claus.</p>

<p>‘Wait! My pie!’ exclaimed Merrythought,
pulling it from his pocket. ‘I
will break it in two and share with
you.’</p>

<p>The pie was so small it could be eaten
in two bites, but Santa Claus and Merrythought
did not speak of that. They only
said how good it was and how well Belinda
baked for a girl of her years.</p>

<p>The little pie plate was made of tin,
and as the sleigh moved off Merrythought
took aim and sent it flying straight at
the little front door.</p>

<p>Clatter! Clatter! Rush!</p>

<p>Out on the doorstep tumbled the seven
children, head-first, pell-mell. They spied
the toys, they seized them, they screamed
for joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Santa Claus and Merrythought laughed
aloud, they were so happy too.</p>

<p>‘My sled! My skates!’</p>

<p>‘A sleepy doll! She really sleeps!’</p>

<p>‘See my Jumping Jack! He jumps
so high!’</p>

<p>‘Look! Look! My Jack-in-the-Box!’</p>

<p>‘A real little key and it locks as tight
as tight can be!’</p>

<p>‘Tinkle! Tinkle! Tinkle!’ from the
woolly lamb.</p>

<p>Merrythought leaned from the sleigh
and waved his hand, though of course
the children could not see him at all.</p>

<p>‘Too many toys, Merrythought?’
asked Santa Claus, looking down at the
Brownie at his side.</p>

<p>Merrythought laughed and shook his
head.</p>

<p>‘No, not enough toys,’ answered he.
‘The moment I reach home I am going
to begin to make toys for those seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
children for next year. But best of all,
Santa Claus, I have found Christmas,’
said Merrythought. ‘I have found Christmas
again.’</p>
